A drop down must be placed at the display which gives three options, i.e, corpus1, corpus2, corpus3
When clicked on any corpus, a paragraph of text has to appear
Below the paragraph two text boxes with two input values have to be placed to take the inputs from the user
These boxes take in the values for number of tokens and types
These have to be calculated from the paragraph given above and type the number in the input box
Submit button has to be clicked
Evaluation has to be done and according color of the input boxes change and a display message is popped telling whether its right or wrong
If its right, another button is shown called continue
When continue is clicked, a next text box pops up asking the user to find the new type
this new type is found by the snowball stemmer where the paragraph is stemmed and the unique repeated values are counted as one
Submit will again give the result if the entered value and the number of new types match.
