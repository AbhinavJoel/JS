JavaScript was initially created to “make web pages alive”.

The programs in this language are called scripts. They can be written right in a web page’s HTML and run automatically as the page loads.

Scripts are provided and executed as plain text. They don’t need special preparation or compilation to run.
here are at least three great things about JavaScript:

Full integration with HTML/CSS.
Simple things are done simply.
Support by all major browsers and enabled by default.
JavaScript is the only browser technology that combines these three things.

That’s what makes JavaScript unique. That’s why it’s the most widespread tool for creating browser interfaces.

That said, JavaScript also allows to create servers, mobile applications, etc.

The <script> tag contains JavaScript code which is automatically executed when the browser processes the tag.
